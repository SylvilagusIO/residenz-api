# burokrat-residenz-api

The goal of this project is to define a common exchange format for performing a
residency registration, which is required in most EU countries.

The format should define the fields to be entered in typical EU forms in a
standardized and cross-border reusable way.

The first example is based on the Munich forms and will be used as a basis for
further abstraction and standardization.
